Welcome to my console Inventory Solution!
This is a program was done in C# (.NET 8) and it gives you the chance to do these options:

1 - Add a product in the inventory (name, price and stock quantity);
2 - Remove an existing product from the inventory;
3 - Update a quantity from a product in the inventory;
4 - List all the products in the inventory;
5 - Search for items with a specific name;
6 - Get a report from the product below the specified stock;
7 - List all the producst ordered by the stock quantity;

I tried to do these dynamic as possible, when a value is entered that does not go according the Model Data (like adding a string when you need to add a decimal) the program tells you and gives all the information that you need to use the console app.

Thanks!
